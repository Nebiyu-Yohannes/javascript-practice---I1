 ---------------  Javascript - intermediate - practice notes -----------------------




** "use strict";  --> this is recommended at the beginning of the js file 


** console.log(``); --> Use the `` symbol to print or output strings and objects


** let, const and var 
        --> var - these variables/objects can be re-declared and updated
        --> let - these variables/objects can be updated but can not be re-declared
        --> const - these variables/objects can't neither be re-declared nor updated
