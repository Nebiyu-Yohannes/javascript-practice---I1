 ---------------  Javascript - intermediate - practice notes -----------------------




** "use strict";  --> this is recommended at the beginning of the js file 


** console.log(``); --> Use the `` symbol to print or output strings and objects


** let, const and var 
        --> var - /within their scope/ these variables/objects can be re-declared and updated
        --> let - /within their scope/ these variables/objects can be updated but can not be re-declared
        --> const - /within their scope/ these variables/objects can't neither be re-declared nor updated

        In terms of scope: var -- global/function scoped
                         : let/const -- block scoped


**Instance 
        --> when trying to access or operate on instances, make sure to use "this.property"



** methods /getters/

        get name (){
                return this._name  // --> can not be used directly on the class (on the constructor variable)
        }                               -> used on the instance variable



** methods /calls/

        to print out a value of a property for an instance
                console.log(object.property)

        **to call a function on an object:- 
                    -->    "object.function"
                

** Inheritance

        --> it is when a child class inherits from a parent class
        --> a class could also inherits from another class by extending it 
        
        --> The super keyword calls the constructor of the parent class. In this case, super(name) passes the name argument of the Cat class to the constructor of the Animal class.
